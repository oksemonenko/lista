## Procedure of development ##
### Current stage ###

#### For developer ####
You need to markup static pages, without frameworks (like Bootstrap).
You should create branch, name it as your task name, commit to the one of all your progress. After finishing the task you make a pull request, get comments, make changes (it may happens several time).

#### For code reviewer ####
You need to analyze pull requests, comment them (if nessasary) and inform a developer about it. If task is finished, you merge the pull request and check applicable task in Asana.

#### For tester ####
If you find a bug you should make an issue.
In the issue you describe the substance of the problem and
condition of appearing the bug.
It is good practice, if you'll say how it has to work properly.
